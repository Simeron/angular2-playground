# Angular Essential Training - Simeron using Lynda tutorial 

I really wanted to learn Angular 2, both for myself to gain the skill of working with Angular 2 and as en essential skill for my job. 
 
## Before starting the training
Going into the training I already had a good knowledge of HTML and CSS, my JavaScript level wasn't as strong, but I will still keen to learn. 

## During the learning 
I learnt a lot from this course. I did have quite a few issues along the way. This meant it took me longer than expected to complete. 
Although I was following the tutorials very closely some of the material for each training session was pre-loaded which meant I needed to source this from somewhere in order for me to move forward with the training. I was able to do this using the 'live demo' windows which were available. However in the end I had to find the source code and refer to this a few times to make sure I was up to date with the right code. 
 
This causing me with quite a few issues and some errors which I couldn't fix and I was spending far to much time on. 
 
In the end I had to move on. I completed the course and tried to fix as many error along the way as I could. 

## In conclusion 
I learnt a lot about angular 2 and I am keen to apply what I have learnt in this course to projects of my own to expand my skills further. 

Once I got to the end of the course I wanted a working version which I could refer to in future to aid me when working on my own applications. So I made sure all of the relevant files matched the ones of the tutorial. 

The link to the tutorial I used is [here the course is on Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/AngularJS-tutorials/Angular-2-Essential-Training/540347-2.html)
This is something I would recommend to anyone who is looking to learn more about Angular. 

##### Tips for when I revisit this: 
* When you need to run the server find the relevant folder and run the following: 
`npm start` if I am missing some modules then run the following: `npm install`
